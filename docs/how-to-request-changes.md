# How to Request Changes

This guide explains how teachers can easily request changes to the Mergington High School Activities website.

## Creating a New Request

When you need to make a change to the website, you can create an issue using one of our templates. These templates will guide you through providing all the necessary information.

### Steps to Create a Request

1. Go to the [Issues page](../../issues)
2. Click the **"New Issue"** button
3. Choose the template that best matches your request:
   - **Bug Report** - Something is broken or not working correctly
   - **Feature Request** - You want to add something new to the website
   - **Design or Styling Change** - You want to change colors, layout, or appearance
   - **Content or Activity Update** - You need to update activity information or text

4. Fill out the form with as much detail as possible
5. Click **"Submit new issue"**
